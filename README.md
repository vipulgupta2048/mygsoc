(Deprecated) Google Summer of Code with 2048

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.

Hi, I am **Vipul Gupta** and the following is information regarding my work with 2 organisation whom I participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 and 2019. You might have reached this URL through GSoC official website. This repository acts has a placeholder for everything.

**Work Report** - [Final Work Report # GSoC 2019](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com/2019/08/24/integrate-cerberus-work-report/)

Spidermon is a recommended tool for monitoring spiders created using Scrapy. The user at the time can choose between two libraries for item validation rules: jsonschema and schematics. We want to provide a third option that being Cerberus.

Cerberus provides powerful yet simple and lightweight data validation functionality out of the box and is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for custom validation. It has no dependencies and is thoroughly tested on several Python versions.

The goal of this project was to integrate, test and enable Cerberus as a new option for item validation available for the user.
